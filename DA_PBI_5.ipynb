        "Your colleague is delighted with the dashboard you provided him the previous week, but he has some remarks about the overall look of the dashboard:\n",
        "- Some of the metrics and dimensions in charts are not clearly labeled\n",
        "- Some chart formatting is a bit confusing and could be worked on\n",
        "- The whole dashboard does not follow your company's branding because you used a dark blue color which does not fit your company’s colors. Choose any other colors of the existing company and adjust the dashboard to suit them. (Or adjust the colors according to your preference)\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Colleague also remembered that one of your exec team members is color blind, and some charts are confusing\n",
        "- Your colleague realized that date filters at the top of the dashboard do not apply to all visualizations. Find a way to overcome this problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should make a copy of the final dashboard from the hands-on task to clean it up and make it more interactive and advanced. Feel free to work with anything from formatting to adding completely new graphs and insights. Since this sprint requires more creativity, this graded task is a bit more open and obscure than in other sprints. However, keep in mind that evaluation criteria are also more open to different creative solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an alternative, you can come up with a completely new dashboard if you wish. The only requirement is using the same [AdventureWorks company data](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?authuser=3&project=tc-da-1&ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1stc-da-1!2sadwentureworks_db) to construct your dashboard. Once again, remember that we are giving you some freedom in your Graded Task, though we expect you to utilize tools you have learned as well as making sure that you follow the guidelines you have learned in this sprint. Make sure you take into consideration the dashboard structure and ways to make sure the user understands the data you intend to present. For this, you will have to come up with your insights about data and make sure those insights tell a consistent and coherent story.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write SQL queries to extract needed data. These queries should be well documented, with indentation, and provided as custom queries in a separate file, clearly identifying which datasets in the dashboard they reflect.\n",
